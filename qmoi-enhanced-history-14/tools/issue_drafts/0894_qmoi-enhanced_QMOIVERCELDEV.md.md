# Review needed: qmoi-enhanced/QMOIVERCELDEV.md

Status: AUTOMATED_REMOVAL_FROM_DONEREFS

Suggested next steps:

- Inspect the file and its [AUTOFIXED by Ollama at 2026-07-26T18:54:42.007333Z] markers or [AUTOFIXED by Ollama at 2026-07-26T18:54:42.007333Z]s.
- If the file is safe for production, remove the [AUTOFIXED by Ollama at 2026-07-26T18:54:42.007333Z] and add tests / small PR.
- If the file is intentionally non-production (e.g. simulated or cache), consider moving it out of the repo or documenting its purpose.
- After changes, re-run `scripts/verify_and_finalize_done.py` to include the file back in `donerefs.txt`.

# QMOI Vercel Developer Automation (QMOIVERCELDEV)

> **See also:** [QMOIDEV.md](QMOIDEV.md)

## QMOI as a Developer & Notification Agent
- QMOI always identifies as an AI Developer in all notifications (email, Slack, etc.).
- All notifications include platform, job, fix, and error context.
- QMOI logs, retries, and uses fallback channels for all notifications.
- QMOI monitors for email replies, parses commands, and updates memory/context.
- All errors, fixes, and notifications are logged and used to improve future actions.

## Overview
QMOI now automates Vercel deployment, error fixing, backup, and UI integration:
- Detects and fixes build/deploy errors
- Auto-redeploys and logs all actions
- Backs up code, configs, and logs
- Integrates with master-only UI for control and logs

## Features
- **Automated Deployment:**
  - Deploys to Vercel with advanced error pattern matching
  - Retries deploys after auto-fix
- **Error Fixing & Self-Healing:**
  - Detects and fixes all build/deploy errors
  - Logs all actions and fixes
- **Backup & Auto-Evolution:**
  - Backs up all code, configs, and logs
  - Maintains changelog and evolves based on error/fix history
- **UI Integration:**
  - Master-only UI for pipeline/log/resource control
  - Real-time status, logs, and manual/auto triggers

## Usage
- Configure `.env` and Vercel tokens
- Push code or trigger deploy
- QMOI will auto-fix errors, redeploy, and log all actions
- View status/logs in QCity/QI UI (master only)

## Extension Points
- Add new Vercel features or integrations
- Extend error-fixing and backup logic
- Integrate with more UI panels or controls

## Troubleshooting
- All errors, fixes, and actions are
```

<!-- BEGIN QMOI MANAGED: repository-surface-audit -->
## Agent-managed repository surface audit

- Status: `NEEDS_REVIEW`; materialized files: `10435`; directories: `1269`; Markdown: `2418`.
- API/endpoint candidates: `962`; route candidates: `737`; components: `1384`; automation/event candidates: `553`.
- Managed-document family candidates: `app_platform=2155, build_download_install=2110, orchestration=2061, qteam_accountability=2050, release_tag_publish=2089, tree_inventory=2000`.
- Project/autoproject registry documents discovered: `4`; coverage refreshes these docs and model-card headings, but discovery is not implementation or completion proof.
- Active-root Markdown refresh targets combine stable core names, `ALL*` names, and content/path family matches for app/platform, build/download/install, release/tag/publish, QTeam/accountability, orchestration, and repository-tree documentation. Historical/archive candidates are audited but never rewritten as active docs.
- `TREE.md` is the canonical full indexed path tree: directories, every indexed file path and scope/status, plus skipped/unavailable path reasons. It is local materialized scope only; ignored roots, inaccessible paths, Git-history trees, and remote refs remain explicit limitations.
- Markdown structural checks passed: `2223`; needs review: `187`; metric candidate lines: `52722`; percentage occurrences: `22237`.
- Markdown word count: `3552546`; heuristic sentence count: `673863`; sentence records indexed: `673863`; sentence records beyond the bound: `0`.
- Sentence review candidates: `29844` metric claims; `10662` completion claims; `29747` metric and `10533` completion claims lack an inline reference marker. Reference markers are candidates, not proof.
- Word-integrity candidates: `9046` adjacent-repeat candidates; sentence and normalized word-sequence hashes are stored without source prose. Grammar and semantic truth remain unverified.
- Formula/calculation candidate lines: `13340`; percentage aggregates are grouped per source file and explicitly unclassified, not model-comparison proof.
- Surface manifest and source hashes: `QMOItracks/repository_surface_audit.json`; the generated report is excluded from its own digest.
- Instruction candidates: `40017` lines in `3670` files; each requires semantic requirement-to-code/test/workflow mapping.
- Production-gap candidates: `287`; status `NEEDS_REVIEW`; automatic replacement authorized: `False`.
- Checks cover encoding, headings, fences, unresolved markers, local links, hashes, paths, and metric locations. They do not prove sentence semantics, feature truth, benchmark superiority, or production readiness.
- Local roots/refs are not proof of all remote repositories, PRs, or intermediate commit trees. Production candidates remain review items; no bulk replacement is authorized.
