# Review needed: QMOI-OPTIMIZATION.md

Status: AUTOMATED_REMOVAL_FROM_DONEREFS

Suggested next steps:

- Inspect the file and its [AUTOFIXED by Ollama at 2026-07-26T18:54:41.749330Z] markers or [AUTOFIXED by Ollama at 2026-07-26T18:54:41.749330Z]s.
- If the file is safe for production, remove the [AUTOFIXED by Ollama at 2026-07-26T18:54:41.749330Z] and add tests / small PR.
- If the file is intentionally non-production (e.g. simulated or cache), consider moving it out of the repo or documenting its purpose.
- After changes, re-run `scripts/verify_and_finalize_done.py` to include the file back in `donerefs.txt`.

# QMOI Optimization Guide

## Overview
This guide covers all strategies and features used by QCity/QMOI to optimize performance, minimize size, and maximize efficiency on any device or cloud.

## Key Optimization Features
- **Atomic/Temp Installs:** All dependencies are installed in a temp directory, then atomically moved to node_modules for reliability and speed.
- **Deduplication:** Duplicate dependencies are removed using npm/yarn/pnpm dedupe.
- **Tree-Shaking & Pruning:** Unused code and dependencies are removed before/after build/install.
- **On-Demand Loading:** Only required modules/features are loaded at runtime.
- **Compression:** Assets, logs, and artifacts are compressed for storage and transfer.
- **Minimal Local Footprint:** node_modules, build files, and caches are stored in QCity/cloud, with overlays/symlinks for local use.
- **Resource-Aware Execution:** Heavy tasks are throttled, offloaded, or scheduled for off-peak times.
- **Background/Parallel Execution:** Installs/builds/tests run in the background or in parallel, never blocking the UI or slowing the device.
- **Auto-Cleanup:** All temp files, caches, and unused artifacts are cleaned up after every operation.

## How to Use
- Enable/disable optimization features in `config/qcity-device-config.json`.
- Use the dashboard to monitor and trigger optimizations.
- See `API.md` for optimization endpoints.

## Device Resource Optimization Techniques (Expanded)
- **Multi-Language Support:** QCity manages Node, Python, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, and more, handling all dependencies and tools atomically and efficiently.
- **Environment Detection:** Automatically detects and configures environments for each language.
- **Resource-Awa

<!-- BEGIN QMOI MANAGED: repository-surface-audit -->
## Agent-managed repository surface audit

- Status: `NEEDS_REVIEW`; materialized files: `10435`; directories: `1269`; Markdown: `2418`.
- API/endpoint candidates: `962`; route candidates: `737`; components: `1384`; automation/event candidates: `553`.
- Managed-document family candidates: `app_platform=2155, build_download_install=2110, orchestration=2061, qteam_accountability=2050, release_tag_publish=2089, tree_inventory=2000`.
- Project/autoproject registry documents discovered: `4`; coverage refreshes these docs and model-card headings, but discovery is not implementation or completion proof.
- Active-root Markdown refresh targets combine stable core names, `ALL*` names, and content/path family matches for app/platform, build/download/install, release/tag/publish, QTeam/accountability, orchestration, and repository-tree documentation. Historical/archive candidates are audited but never rewritten as active docs.
- `TREE.md` is the canonical full indexed path tree: directories, every indexed file path and scope/status, plus skipped/unavailable path reasons. It is local materialized scope only; ignored roots, inaccessible paths, Git-history trees, and remote refs remain explicit limitations.
- Markdown structural checks passed: `2223`; needs review: `187`; metric candidate lines: `52722`; percentage occurrences: `22237`.
- Markdown word count: `3552546`; heuristic sentence count: `673863`; sentence records indexed: `673863`; sentence records beyond the bound: `0`.
- Sentence review candidates: `29844` metric claims; `10662` completion claims; `29747` metric and `10533` completion claims lack an inline reference marker. Reference markers are candidates, not proof.
- Word-integrity candidates: `9046` adjacent-repeat candidates; sentence and normalized word-sequence hashes are stored without source prose. Grammar and semantic truth remain unverified.
- Formula/calculation candidate lines: `13340`; percentage aggregates are grouped per source file and explicitly unclassified, not model-comparison proof.
- Surface manifest and source hashes: `QMOItracks/repository_surface_audit.json`; the generated report is excluded from its own digest.
- Instruction candidates: `40017` lines in `3670` files; each requires semantic requirement-to-code/test/workflow mapping.
- Production-gap candidates: `287`; status `NEEDS_REVIEW`; automatic replacement authorized: `False`.
- Checks cover encoding, headings, fences, unresolved markers, local links, hashes, paths, and metric locations. They do not prove sentence semantics, feature truth, benchmark superiority, or production readiness.
- Local roots/refs are not proof of all remote repositories, PRs, or intermediate commit trees. Production candidates remain review items; no bulk replacement is authorized.
