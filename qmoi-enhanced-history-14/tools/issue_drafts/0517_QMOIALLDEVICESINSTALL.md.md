# Review needed: QMOIALLDEVICESINSTALL.md

Status: AUTOMATED_REMOVAL_FROM_DONEREFS

Suggested next steps:

- Inspect the file and its [AUTOFIXED by Ollama at 2026-07-26T18:54:41.752548Z] markers or [AUTOFIXED by Ollama at 2026-07-26T18:54:41.752548Z]s.
- If the file is safe for production, remove the [AUTOFIXED by Ollama at 2026-07-26T18:54:41.752548Z] and add tests / small PR.
- If the file is intentionally non-production (e.g. simulated or cache), consider moving it out of the repo or documenting its purpose.
- After changes, re-run `scripts/verify_and_finalize_done.py` to include the file back in `donerefs.txt`.

yes to all, t# QMOI All Devices Install & Autotest Strategies

This document details all strategies, measures, and automated tests used to ensure QMOI apps install and run successfully on every supported device. It also describes how errors are auto-fixed and how apps remain lightweight and high-performance.

## Universal Installation Strategies
- Platform-specific build tools: Android Studio, Xcode, Electron, PyInstaller, etc.
- Automated packaging, signing, and verification for every binary.
- All binaries are optimized for minimal size and maximum performance.
- Installation instructions, dependencies, and system requirements are auto-generated and updated for every device.
- All download links are autotested and auto-fixed after every build.
- Self-healing CI/CD: .gitlab-ci.yml and all scripts are auto-linted, auto-fixed, and re-run on error.

## Device-Specific Measures & Autotests

### Android
- Universal APK/App Bundle, architecture checks, auto-update, voice control, offline mode.
- Autotest: Install APK on emulator/device, check for parsing errors, verify launch and permissions.
- Auto-fix: Rebuild APK, check manifest, re-sign if needed.

### Windows
- 64-bit .exe, digital signing, SmartScreen bypass, system tray, touchscreen, widgets.
- Autotest: Install .exe on VM/device, verify launch, check dependencies.
- Auto-fix: Rebuild with correct arch, re-sign, add missing dependencies.

### macOS
- .dmg/.app, code signing, Apple Silicon support, Spotlight/Siri integration.
- Autotest: Install .dmg/.app, verify launch, check for notarization issues.
- Auto-fix: Re-sign, rebuild for correct arch, update entitlements.

### Linux
- .AppImage/.deb/.rpm, execute perm

<!-- BEGIN QMOI MANAGED: repository-surface-audit -->
## Agent-managed repository surface audit

- Status: `NEEDS_REVIEW`; materialized files: `10428`; directories: `1268`; Markdown: `2416`.
- API/endpoint candidates: `962`; route candidates: `737`; components: `1384`; automation/event candidates: `553`.
- Managed-document family candidates: `app_platform=2155, build_download_install=2109, orchestration=2061, qteam_accountability=2049, release_tag_publish=2088, tree_inventory=2000`.
- Project/autoproject registry documents discovered: `4`; coverage refreshes these docs and model-card headings, but discovery is not implementation or completion proof.
- Active-root Markdown refresh targets combine stable core names, `ALL*` names, and content/path family matches for app/platform, build/download/install, release/tag/publish, QTeam/accountability, orchestration, and repository-tree documentation. Historical/archive candidates are audited but never rewritten as active docs.
- `TREE.md` is the canonical full indexed path tree: directories, every indexed file path and scope/status, plus skipped/unavailable path reasons. It is local materialized scope only; ignored roots, inaccessible paths, Git-history trees, and remote refs remain explicit limitations.
- Markdown structural checks passed: `2221`; needs review: `187`; metric candidate lines: `52705`; percentage occurrences: `22237`.
- Markdown word count: `3550281`; heuristic sentence count: `673664`; sentence records indexed: `673664`; sentence records beyond the bound: `0`.
- Sentence review candidates: `29834` metric claims; `10658` completion claims; `29737` metric and `10529` completion claims lack an inline reference marker. Reference markers are candidates, not proof.
- Word-integrity candidates: `9046` adjacent-repeat candidates; sentence and normalized word-sequence hashes are stored without source prose. Grammar and semantic truth remain unverified.
- Formula/calculation candidate lines: `13328`; percentage aggregates are grouped per source file and explicitly unclassified, not model-comparison proof.
- Surface manifest and source hashes: `QMOItracks/repository_surface_audit.json`; the generated report is excluded from its own digest.
- Instruction candidates: `39967` lines in `3666` files; each requires semantic requirement-to-code/test/workflow mapping.
- Production-gap candidates: `286`; status `NEEDS_REVIEW`; automatic replacement authorized: `False`.
- Checks cover encoding, headings, fences, unresolved markers, local links, hashes, paths, and metric locations. They do not prove sentence semantics, feature truth, benchmark superiority, or production readiness.
- Local roots/refs are not proof of all remote repositories, PRs, or intermediate commit trees. Production candidates remain review items; no bulk replacement is authorized.
