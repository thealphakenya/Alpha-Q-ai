## Universal UI access modes and per-user feature creation

All apps and cloned-platform consoles use the same public, authenticated-user, and master-operator access model. App-specific screens may add capabilities but may not weaken these checks.

### public_guest
- Public catalog, public documentation, public previews, and safe anonymous browsing.
- No user-specific data, private workspace, account action, or protected mutation.

### authenticated_user
- Verified identity, consent, session state, personal settings, and user-owned workspace.
- Account, wallet, purchase, upload, private media, and write actions require server-side authorization.

### master_operator
- Explicit master role, MFA or equivalent step-up verification, current capability, and audit context.
- Administrative mutations require backend authorization and human confirmation where impact is high.

### Per-user UI generation

- Generate or configure account-specific UI only after verified identity, consent, tenant/user scope, and server-provided capabilities are available.
- Keep guest/public browsing useful without exposing private data; upgrade to account features only through explicit sign-in and consent.
- Personalization may adjust preferences and layout but cannot create permissions, reveal another user's data, suppress risk warnings, or trigger financial/hosting/quantum actions.
- Account creation, MFA, consent, payments, OS permission grants, production deployment, and quantum spend remain human-confirmed actions when required by policy.
- Record access-mode transitions and denial reasons without writing credentials, tokens, or private user content to docs or logs.

## Agent-managed feature, test, and event accountability contract

Automation may inventory and test preauthorized repository changes without a person present, but may not bypass repository policy, branch protection, user consent, provider permissions, or required human approvals for high-impact actions.

- A feature is complete only when its implementation, UI/API access boundary, tests, docs, and event integrations agree for an exact repository/ref/SHA.
- Every file mutation records path, owner, prior/new hashes, reason, validation, and authorization context; failed or skipped work remains visible.
- Hooks/webhooks require authentication/signatures, replay and idempotency controls, bounded retries, secret-reference-only handling, audit logging, and tested failure paths.
- A feature without a mapped test or verified event integration remains `unmapped` or `blocked`; total automation claims cannot exceed inspected scope.
- Trading automation remains paused on stale market/account data, invalid authorization, provider outage, risk-limit breach, or ledger mismatch; runtime independence requires separately verified hosts and fresh heartbeat evidence.
